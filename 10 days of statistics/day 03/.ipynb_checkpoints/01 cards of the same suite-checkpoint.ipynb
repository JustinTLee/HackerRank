    "The first card you draw has a probability of 1 because the suite hasn't been chosen yet. The first card will set the suite that the next card has to align to. Since 1 card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck, and 12 cards left of that particular suite in the deck. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{12}{51}$."
